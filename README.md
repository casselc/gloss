Gloss is a byte-format DSL.It can turn complicated byte formats into Clojure data structures, allowing
for easy use of custom network protocols and C libraries.  It can also turn Clojure data structures into
compact byte representations, allowing for efficient use of bandwidth and disk.

Read more about it in [the wiki](https://github.com/ztellman/gloss/wiki).

## note

This is a fork w/ minor updates to eliminate reflection-related errors on newer JVM, update dependencies, and conversion to deps.edn.
