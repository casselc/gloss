# gloss [![Clojure CI](https://github.com/casselc/gloss/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/casselc/gloss/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Gloss is a byte-format DSL.It can turn complicated byte formats into Clojure data structures, allowing
for easy use of custom network protocols and C libraries.  It can also turn Clojure data structures into
compact byte representations, allowing for efficient use of bandwidth and disk.

Read more about it in [the wiki](https://github.com/ztellman/gloss/wiki).
